Make Change Project

MakeChange is a program that makes a "cash register" that takes user input and gives out change. The user enters the total price they are have to pay as well as the amount they are paying. The program takes the paid amount and subtracts the price from it to calculate the total amount of change. It then takes that total and reads out how many $10, $5, and $1 bills the user would be receiving in change as well as how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies they would be receiving as well. At the end of the change reading the user will be prompted to enter new amounts or to leave which would stop the program. If the user enters an amount less than what the price is, they will receive an error of an invalid payment and prompt them to try again. If the user pays in exact change it will inform them that they did so and stop the program.
